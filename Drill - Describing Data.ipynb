    "For this data, the mean and the median are fairly close. The mode is not useful in this case. If you are concerned about outliers, the median tends to be less affected by outliers than the mean. We don't have significant outliers with this data, so I'd personally go with the mean since the idea of an average makes intuitive sense to me. Also, many calculations involving the mean are more straightforward. And, estimates of variance depend on the mean. In the case of standard error, it \"quantifies the uncertainity in the estimate of the sample mean.\"  So it makes sense to talk about both at the same time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Generally, standard error and standard deviation are more useful estimates of variability in the data because they have the same units as the original data (unlike variance which is the units squared). If you're more interested in the variability in the population, then using the standard deviation is probably more useful. If you're more interested in the precision of the sample mean, then using the standard error is probably better."
